    <h1>INFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19 (CORONAVIRUS)</h1>

    <p>
        <h3> WHAT IS COVID-19? </h3>
        
        COVID-19, otherwise known as coronavirus disease 2019, is a new infectious disease that affects your lungs and airways. <br>

        <h3> What are the symptoms of Covid-19? </h3>
        
        Most people who feel ill with COVID-19 will have at least one of the key symptoms: <br>
        <ol>
            <li> Fever </li>
            
            <li> Dry Cough </li>
            
            <li> Triedness</li>
            
            <li> Loss of taste or smell </li>
        
        </ol>
        
        Other symptoms include:<br>
        
        <ol>
            <li> Nasal Congestion </li>
            
            <li> Conjunctivitis (Red Eyes) </li>
            
            <li> Sore throat</li>
            
            <li> Headache </li>
            
            <li> Muscle of joint pain</li>
            
            <li> Skin rash </li>
            
            <li> Vomiting </li>
            
            <li> Diarrhoea </li>
            
            <li> Dizziness </li>

        </ol>
          
        Some people get more seriously ill with COVID-19 and may have symptoms such as: <br>
        <ol>
            <li> Shortness of breath</li>

            <li> Loss of appetite</li>

            <li> Chest pain </li>

            <li> High temperature</li>

        </ol>
        
        These people will need medical care. In severe cases, COVID-19 can lead to death.

        COVID-19 affects different people in different ways: <br>
        Some people do not have any symptoms and may not even know they have the virus.<br> 
        You can still pass COVID-19 on even if you aren’t showing any symptoms, so it’s important to always follow the prevention advice.<br>

        <h3>  How to prevent the spread of germs when caring for someone who is sick? </h3>
        <ol> 
            <li> Have the person stay in one room, away from other people, including yourself, as much as possible. </li>

            <li> If possible, have them use a separate bathroom. </li>

            <li> Avoid sharing personal household items, like dishes, towels, and bedding </li>
            
            <li> Have them wear a cloth face covering (that covers their nose and mouth) when they are around people, including you. </li>

            <li> If the sick person can’t wear a cloth face covering, you should wear one while in the same room with them. </li>

            <li> If the sick person needs to be around others (within the home, in a vehicle, or doctor’s office), they should wear a cloth face covering that covers their mouth and nose.</li>

            <li> Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after interacting with the sick person. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>

            <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. </li>

        </ol>
